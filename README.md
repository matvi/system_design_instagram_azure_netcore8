This article will guide you through the process of crafting and constructing an Instagram-like platform utilizing Azure and .Net 8

I walk you through all the steps of a System Design interview, using Instagram as a real-world example. You'll learn how to design and build an Instagram-like platform from scratch, leveraging Azure cloud infrastructure and .NET 8. I cover both functional and non-functional requirements, capacity estimation, database choices (SQL vs. NoSQL), and the logic behind key architectural decisions. Watch as I deploy the application into Azure, utilizing services like CosmosDB, Blob Storage, Azure CDN, and more, showcasing best practices for scalability, performance, and system integration.

I explore the logical architecture of an Instagram-like platform, focusing on how various Azure services work together to deliver a scalable, low-latency solution for a fast-loading news feed.

Post Service, Feed Service, Rank Service, Like Service, and Friend Service: These services handle key features like posts, likes, and user interactions. By separating them into microservices, we ensure that each can scale independently to handle demand. This helps maintain performance under high traffic, particularly for feed generation. RankService: Contains logic to determine which users see a shared post, based on likes and user relationships. It ensures that the most relevant content is shown, improving user engagement. PostProcessor Service: Pre-computes users' timelines to ensure their feeds load quickly, reducing the need for real-time calculations, which improves overall feed loading times.

CosmosDB: A NoSQL database that provides: Global distribution: Replicates data across multiple regions for low-latency access. Scalability: Automatically adjusts throughput and storage. Availability: Ensures 99.999% availability with built-in redundancy. High throughput: Handles millions of operations per second, crucial for handling large volumes of user posts and interactions. Unlimited storage: Manages massive amounts of user-generated content and metadata.

BlobStorage: Azure BlobStorage is specialized for storing any type of file, including images and videos. It ensures fast, scalable media storage and works seamlessly with Azure CDN to: Deliver both static and dynamic content at ultra-fast speeds. Reduce latency by decreasing the physical distance between the content location and the end user, which is crucial for fast-loading media in user feeds.

Azure CDN: Caches and delivers static content (e.g., images and videos) closer to the user. By using Azure CDN, we ensure ultra-fast load times for media assets, significantly improving the overall experience when users scroll through their news feed.

Azure Service Bus: This message broker manages asynchronous communication between services. It ensures reliable message delivery and decouples services, allowing each component to scale independently, making the system more robust and scalable.

Redis: Redis provides: Throughput increase: Boosts data throughput by over 800% compared to traditional SQL databases. Latency improvement: Improves response times by over 1000%, enabling rapid data retrieval for frequently accessed information like user feeds. Redis is a key component for ensuring low-latency feed generation, as it caches data and precomputes feeds, reducing database load and response time.

Load Balancer: Security: Protects the system by distributing traffic across multiple servers, preventing overloads and potential attacks. Scalability: Automatically balances traffic, ensuring that new instances are spun up during traffic spikes. High Availability: Ensures continuous uptime by distributing traffic to healthy instances of services, helping maintain performance even during heavy loads.

Azure WebApps: Hosts the application with automatic scaling, ensuring it can handle millions of users without downtime.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automates updates and feature rollouts, ensuring the system stays up to date without disruption.

By leveraging these Azure services, the platform can efficiently handle high user traffic, provide low-latency feed loads, and offer a scalable architecture that grows with user demand. The combination of caching, global distribution, load balancing, and microservices ensures a fast, reliable, and responsive experience for all users
